## Programming Language & Development Tool
------------------------------------------

### **Programming Language**

A ``programming language`` is a computer language programmers use to develop software programs, scripts, or other sets of instructions for computers to execute.

Although many languages share similarities, each has its own syntax. Once a programmer learns the languages rules, syntax, and structure, they write the source code in a text editor or IDE. Then, the programmer often compiles the code into machine language that can be understood by the computer. Scripting languages, which do not require a compiler, use an interpreter to execute the script.

**Types of programming languages**
Each of the different programming languages mentioned in the next section can be broken into one or more of the following types (paradigms) of languages.

``Machine language`` is easier for the computer to understand but harder for the programmer to understand. This is because machine language is simply the language of machines—bits. Sometimes, programmers will develop programs directly with machine code, but because this is difficult to understand and tedious to type, it is more common to program using assembly or a high-level language. 

``Assembly language`` is slightly easier to understand. The bits of machine language are replaced by numbers and English commands. Before assembly code is run by the computer, it is assembled by an assembler. This converts the code back into the 1s and 0s of machine language that the computer can understand.

``High-Level languages`` use many more English commands and are significantly more readable than assembly or machine language. Many high-level languages have built-in commands that help the programmer write loops, create variables of different data types, and manipulate strings. It is worth noting that all of these are possible in assembly or machine language, but high-level languages make them much easier for the programmer to read, write, and debug. Some newer high-level languages are scripting languages. This means that they are not compiled, or translated into machine language, until just before the code is executed at runtime. Python, Javascript, PHP, Ruby, and Bash are all scripting languages.

### **Development Tool**

A ``programming tool`` or ``software development tool`` is a computer program that software developers use to create, debug, maintain, or otherwise support other programs and applications. The term usually refers to relatively simple programs, that can be combined to accomplish a task, much as one might use multiple hands to fix a physical object. The most basic tools are a source code editor and a compiler or interpreter, which are used ubiquitously and continuously. Other tools are used more or less depending on the language, development methodology, and individual engineer, often used for a discrete task, like a debugger or profiler. Tools may be discrete programs, executed separately – often from the command line – or may be parts of a single large program, called an integrated development environment (IDE). In many cases, particularly for simpler use, simple ad hoc techniques are used instead of a tool, such as print debugging instead of using a debugger, manual timing (of overall program or section of code) instead of a profiler, or tracking bugs in a text file or spreadsheet instead of a bug tracking system.

**Integrated Development Environments (IDE)**

An ``IDE`` is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger.

## Selecting Language & Tool

### Selecting Language

#### Type of application
Web applications, mobile applications, embedded firmware, etc. – the type of application you’re developing heavily influences what languages are available for us to choose from. General programming languages like Java, JavaScript, Python and C# can build different types of applications on different platforms. There are also cases where specific languages work better. For example, building a native Android app requires knowledge of Java, building a native iOS app requires a Swift or Objective-C skill set, whereas knowledge of C or C++ is critical if you’re working with embedded firmware.

- Front End Development: ``JavaScript``, ``HTML``, and ``CSS``
- Backend Development: ``Python``, ``C#`` or ``JavaScript``
- Game Development: ``C#`` or ``C++``
- Data Science/Machine Learning/Analytics: ``Python``, ``R``, ``Clojure``,``Julia``
- Math & Scientific Computing: ``Matlab``, ``FORTRAN``, ``ALGOL``, ``APL``, ``Julia``, ``R``, ``C++``
- Big Data: ``Java``, ``Python``, ``R``, ``Scala``, ``Clojure``
- Operating Systems: ``C``, ``C++``
- Distributed System: ``C``, ``Go``, ``Rust``

#### Availability of libraries:

If a language has a library that solves your domain problem, it might be work putting up with some ugly calling conventions or hassle in the language.

#### Scalability and Performance

Scalability is more about a technology stack, which in turn determines the programming languages rather than the programming language itself. Some battle-tested and popular stacks that have proven to be capable of such scalability include .NET, LAMP, Ruby on Rails (RoR), MEAN and Java Spring.
