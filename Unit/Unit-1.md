## Defination of Software
-------------------------

``Software`` is the collection of computer programs, procedures and documentation that performs different task on computer system. 

At a very basic level, computer software consists of a machine language tahat consist of group of binary values, which specify processor instruction. The processor instruction changes the state of computer hardware in a predefined sequence. Briefy, computer software is a language which computer speaks.

## Types of Software
-------------------------

Types of ``Software`` are:

- ``System Software``
    - Operating System
    - Utility Software
    - Language Processor
        - Compiler
        - Interpeter
        - Assembler
- ``Application Software``
    - Package Software
    - Tailored Software

**Explanation:**

### **``System Software:``**
``System software`` is computer software designed to operate the computer hardware and to provide a platform for running application softwares.It helps in running computer hardware and the computer system. System software is a collection of operating systems, device drivers, servers, windowing systems and utilities. ``System software`` helps an application programmer in viewing away from hardware, memory and other internal complexities of a computer. Some common types of system software are given below:

#### Operating System:

An ``Operating System (OS)`` is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.

An ``Operating System (OS)`` is a large collection of system software, which manages the resources of computer system such as ``memory``, ``storage``, ``processor``, ``I/O devices`` and it also acts as an interface between machine and user. Moreover, it also performs the basic tasks such as reorganization of peripherial devices, sending-recieving information to the external sources keeping task of files, folders on the disk and other different utility task.

#### **Utility Software:**

``Utility Software`` help manage, maintain and control computer resources. These programs are available to help you with the day-to-day chores associated with personal computing and to keep your system running at peak performance.

#### **Language Processor:**

It is a special type of computer system software that can used to translate program in one language into another language. It is most compulsory for ``low level language`` and ``high level language``. Types of language translator are: 

- **``Compiler:``** It is a language translator program which translate ``high level language program`` into ``machine level program`` at single attempt.

- **``Interpeter:``** It is a language translator program which translate ``high level language`` program into ``machine level`` one instruction at a time.

- **``Assembler:``** It is a language translator program which translate ``assembly language program`` into ``machine level program``.

### **``Application Software:``**

Application software is developed in order to fulfill user requirements. It enables user to accomplish certain specific task. It can useto solve application type of problems. Business software, Database software, and educational software are some forms of application software. Other application software is word processors, spreadsheet ,presentation packages etc. ``Application software`` utilizes the capacity of a computer directly to a dedicated task.

#### **Package Software:**

``Package software`` are generally made by software companies to generalize the tasks. They are general purpose software. Some common types of package software are ``Word Processing Software``, ``Database Software``, ``Spreadsheet Software``, ``Multimedia Software``, ``Presentation Software`` etc. 

#### **Tailored Software:**

``Tailored software`` is specific purpose software software. It is also called small type of software. These types of software are developed for specific task. They are written in high level languages such as ``JAVA``, ``C``, ``C++``, ``Python`` etc. Examples are ``banking software``, ``hospital software``, ``hotel reservation software``, ``billing software`` etc.

## Characteristic of Software
-----------------------------------

Software Characteristics are classified into six major components: 

- ``Functionality``

- Maturity

### **``Efficiency``**

It refers to the ability of the software to use system resources in the most effective and efficient manner. The software should make effective use of storage space and executive command as per desired timing requirements. 

Required functions are: 

- In Time
- In Resource

### **``Usability``**

It refers to the extent to which the software can be used with ease. the amount of effort or time required to learn how to use the software. 

Required functions are: 

- Understandability
- Learnability
- Operability

### **``Maintainability``**

It refers to the ease with which the modifications can be made in a software system to extend its functionality, improve its performance, or correct errors. 

Required functions are:

- Testabilty
- Stability
- Changabilty
- Operability

### **``Portability``**

A set of attributes that bears on the ability of software to be transferred from one environment to another, without or minimum changes. 

Required functions are:

- Adaptability
- Installability
- Replaceability

## Attributes of Good Software
--------------------------------
Software products have a number of associated attribute that reflect the quality of that software. These attributes are not directly concerned with what the software does. They reflect its behavior while it is executing, the structure and organization of source program and associated documentation. The essential attributes of good software are:

- ``Acceptability``: Software must be acceptable to the type of users for which it is designed. This means that it must be understandable, usable, and compatible with other systems that they use.

- ``Dependability and security``: Software dependability includes a range of characteristics including reliability, security, and safety. Dependable software should not cause physical or economic damage in the event of system failure. Software has to be secure so that malicious users cannot access or damage the system.

- ``Efficiency``: Software should not make wasteful use of system resources such as memory and processor cycles. Efficiency therefore includes responsiveness, processing time, resource utilization, etc.

- ``Maintainability``: Software should be written in such a way that it can evolve to meet the changing needs of customers. This is a critical attribute because software change is an inevitable requirement of a changing business environment.

## Defination of Software Engineering
---------------------------------------

``Software engineering`` is defined as a process of analyzing user requirements and then designing, building, and testing software application which will satisfy those requirements.

Let’s look at the various definitions of software engineering:

- ``IEEE, in its standard 610.12-1990``, defines software engineering as the application of a systematic, disciplined, which is a computable approach for the development, operation, and maintenance of software.

- ``Fritz Bauer`` defined it as **‘the establishment and used standard engineering principles. It helps you to obtain, economically, software which is reliable and works efficiently on the real machines’**.

- ``Boehm`` defines software engineering, which involves, **‘the practical application of scientific knowledge to the creative design and building of computer programs. It also includes associated documentation needed for developing, operating, and maintaining them’**.

## Key Challenges that Software Engineering Facing
--------------------------------------------------

The information technology industry is highly complex, vast and dynamic. Software development is an integral part of the industry and is directly influenced by several factors, including growing complexities, market conditions, changing technology trends as well as increasing software development challenges.

Software engineering teams in different domains and business landscapes face varied challenges. For instance, software development projects are now increasingly governed by the “build once, deploy everywhere” paradigm where a single application can run across numerous platforms. Further complicating this issue is the need to integrate different programs and maintain support throughout the product’s lifecycle. In addition, greater demands have been placed on software developers forcing them to work within limited timelines and limited budgets.

In order to drive efficiency in your software development projects and enhance the reliability of your software development initiatives, it is important to understand the major challenges in software development and devise a systematic roadmap to cope with every challenge.

### ``Rapid technology advancement``
Every technology advancement is a blessing for the IT industry. But at the same time, technology evolving at a phenomenal rate leads to an added pressure for software development professionals to leverage these upcoming technology trends in software product development to gain a cutting edge over competitors and stand out in the market.

### ``Increasing customer demands``
Software projects are generally conceptual and are aimed at designing and developing software products that meet varied customer demands. To develop even the simplest application or product, developers must clearly understand the underlying business concept and bring in the required features to satisfy the growing customer demands.

### ``Time limitations``
Software development is a time-game. Developers work under pressured environments and strive to complete project requirements within strict and scanty timelines. This is especially a challenge when working with international clients on multiple time-zones. Time constraints often bring down efficiencies of development teams and lead to mediocre quality software products in the end.

### ``Limited infrastructure/resources``
Another challenge faced by majority of software development companies is a lack of resources or IT infrastructure to execute projects effectively. This could mean a lack of high performance software development tools, powerful computing platforms, inefficient data storage architectures or improper networks and connectivity. Such hindrances bring down productivity and performance of software development teams and impact the overall result.

### ``Conflicts with software testing teams``
In a classic software development project, interpersonal conflicts occur inevitably between software development and testing teams. Several factors contribute to such conflicts like working under high performance pressure, different mindsets, difference in job roles and the very opposite nature of development and testing. If not controlled and managed effectively, these conflicts could hamper the overall project adversely.

To succeed in a dynamic software industry that is driven by changing technology trends and challenged by multiple internal and external factors, your development teams must have a clear understanding of the problems that lie ahead of them and a roadmap to overcome them.

Implementing software development best practices could help reduce these problems to a large extent. Introducing a DevOps team to handle the testing-development crisis, adopting Cloud for seamless network and infrastructure and constantly enhancing the technical knowhow of your software development teams could help you fight some of these major software development challenges and establish a good position in the software market.
